# Arduino & VVVV @NODE13

## Planning the Workshop

Workshop Duration: 3h
Friday, 15th 10am

**Topics:**

(Time est. in minutes)

* (10) Who we are & what this is about
* (10) How does the Arduino Board work
* (30) How to set things up and working – a.k.a. Blink
** Install the Board + Driver
** How to find my COM port
** Super Quick Intro to Arduino IDE
** Upload the Firmata
* (20/25) From the gray boxes into the World
** Blink is fine, gimme more – How to deal with multiple Outputs
** ON/OFF is boring, i want fade (PinMode PWM)
** Physical Pixel - Map
** Servo me (Cam Tracking?)
** Transform to ANALOG out
* (5/10) What is DIGITAL, what is ANALOG, a bit of background theory
* (30) Connect the Physical and the Digital, World to Gray Box
** Once upon a button was pressed (PULL UP & DOWN)
** Turn it up! Potis
** One works like any other - _map_ your way
*** How stuff works: FSR, Bend, Rotary Poti, Distance (Example each)
** Examples on how to apply
* (15) Re-Connect the World Input to Output - OutsideInsideOut
** How to frame delay
** Poti to Servo - or something like this
** Transform and reflect it physically
** Hittest to Servo
* (30) More stuff on filtering, tricks on _Hysteresis_, Queues, et. al.
** Combining different Sensors
** Buffer + peak detection
** Record and Playback
** One Arduino many nodes, how to deal with the singularity
* Other Firmatas (opt.)

## TODO

* small tasks to accomplish
* more mesh generation examples
* examples for transform to physical transformation
* more fancy examples
* collect videos of usage on prototypes
