# Arduino & VVVV @NODE13

## Planning the Workshop

Workshop Duration: 3h
Friday, Feb. 15th 10 am to 1 pm

### Timing

**Intro (5 min)**
 5	Introduction, who we are, what we are going to do and how

**Block 1 (25)**
10	– Install the Arduino Board driver and make sure the hardware connects correctly
 5	– What are we dealing with (Short introduction on Arduino IDE & the Firmata Protocol)
10	– Upload the StandardFirmata to the Arduino (find your Comport, etc)

**Block 2 – Inside out (45 min)**

 5 – Taking a look at the Arduino Module, rough walk through what there is and which pins you have
 5 – First use: Blink it Baby! The Blink example to test the stuff works
10 – +1 / "Graf Bar" – How to use spreads for multiple Outputs
10 – ~stuff / Physical Pixel – How to enable analog Output a.k.a. PWM with PinModes
 5 – +~1 / "Graf Bar Advanced" – Same same but a bit different (gotcha: certain pins only)
10 – Servo me, servo you... – The most fancy pin mode: SERVO (even more gotcha: PWM + SERVO no pin 9+10)


**Break (10 min)**


_95 min left_

**Interlude (10 min)**
10 – What is digital, what is analog in electronics (HIGH,LOW,PWM,SERVO signals) and why i need resistors.


**Block 3 – Outside In (40)**

10 - Click/Clack – Buttons simple, how to set it up (Resistor, PinMode & Report Digital Pins)
 5 – Clack/Click – Buttons with PULL_UP
10 – The Swizz army sensor – Potentiometers (Use of PinMode ANALOG & Explanation on voltage dividers)
 5 – Super Analog – Pencil input (How to roll your own)
 5 – There was Light – Using LDRs (as follow up example on voltage division)
 5 – Under Pressure – Using FSR Sensor (as follow up example on voltage division)
10 – Lego approach – Using sensor breakouts and what you need to know about it

_45 min left_


**Block 4 – The Challange (45)**

Build your own fancy Game-/MIDI-/Whatever-You-Like-Controler.
The strangest ever, but working controller wins!

## TODO

* use pin 11 or 3 for the blink example
* maybe change advanced bar graph example to knight rider
* more mesh generation examples
* examples for transform to physical transformation
